# üéÆ Civilization Game - Complete Development Plan

**Status**: Foundation Complete, Core Gameplay Required  
**Current Phase**: Transition from Lobby System to Functional Game  
**Target**: Fully playable turn-based civilization strategy game  

---

## üö® **Critical Issue Analysis**

### Current State Assessment
After comprehensive review, the application is **technically excellent but functionally incomplete**:

**‚úÖ What Works:**
- Beautiful lobby with pagination, filtering, welcome screen
- WebSocket connections between client/server  
- Game creation and joining system
- Comprehensive type definitions (unused)
- Professional UX patterns and visual design

**‚ùå Critical Gaps:**
1. **No Real Game Logic**: `GameState.executeAction()` only handles 'end_turn'
2. **No Map System**: Game board is empty object `{}`  
3. **No Hex Grid**: Frontend shows placeholder background
4. **No Game Mechanics**: No cities, units, resources, technologies
5. **No Victory Conditions**: Games never actually end meaningfully

**Diagnosis**: The application is a polished lobby system masquerading as a game.

## üéØ **DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP**

### **Phase 1: Core Game Engine (Week 1-2) - FOUNDATION**
*Priority: CRITICAL - Foundation for everything else*

#### 1.1 **Hex Grid Map System** üó∫Ô∏è
```typescript
Deliverables:
- Procedural hex map generation (20x20 tiles)
- Terrain types: grassland, forest, hills, mountains, water
- Resource placement: food, production, luxury resources  
- Fog of war system per player
- Frontend hex grid renderer with click/touch interaction
- Zoom/pan navigation for map exploration

Technical Implementation:
- HexMap class with coordinate system
- MapTile interface with terrain, resources, improvements
- Canvas or SVG rendering for performance
- Touch/mouse event handling for mobile/desktop
```

#### 1.2 **Real Game State Management** ‚öôÔ∏è  
```typescript
Replace mock GameState with functional implementation:

class GameState {
  // Current: empty board = {}
  // Required: Full civilization state
  map: HexMap                    // Actual playable map
  cities: Map<string, City>      // Player cities with population, buildings
  units: Map<string, Unit>       // Military and civilian units
  resources: PlayerResources[]   // Per-player resource tracking
  technologies: TechProgress[]   // Research trees and progress
  executeAction(): boolean       // Handle ALL action types (not just end_turn)
  
  // Game flow methods
  processTurn(): void           // Calculate resource generation, unit movement
  checkVictoryConditions(): VictoryType | null
  validateAction(action: GameAction): boolean
}
```

#### 1.3 **Unit System** üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
```typescript
Basic units for initial gameplay:
- Settler: Found cities, require 1 population
- Warrior: Basic combat unit (10 strength)
- Scout: Fast exploration (3 movement vs 2)
- Worker: Build improvements (farms, mines)

Core Mechanics:
- Movement validation with terrain costs
- Combat resolution with attack/defense
- Unit experience and promotion system
- Stacking rules (1 military + 1 civilian per tile)
```

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Players can see actual hex map instead of green placeholder
- [ ] Units appear on map and can be moved by clicking
- [ ] Basic combat between units works
- [ ] Cities can be founded and appear on map

---

### **Phase 2: City & Resource Management (Week 3-4) - ECONOMY**
*Priority: HIGH - Makes game strategically meaningful*

#### 2.1 **City Founding & Management** üèôÔ∏è
```typescript
City Core Mechanics:
- City founding by settlers (consumes settler unit)
- Population growth: +1 pop per 2 food surplus
- Production queues: Build units, buildings in order
- Tile working: Citizens work tiles within 3-tile radius
- City specialization: Focus on food/production/science

Buildings to Implement:
- Granary: +2 food, +25% food growth
- Barracks: +25% military unit production
- Library: +2 science, +25% science generation
- Walls: +5 city defense, +50% city health
```

#### 2.2 **Resource Collection** üí∞
```typescript
Per-Turn Resource Generation:
- Food ‚Üí Population growth (2 food = 1 population)
- Production ‚Üí Building/unit creation (accumulated until complete)
- Gold ‚Üí Unit maintenance, instant purchases
- Science ‚Üí Technology research progress
- Culture ‚Üí Social policies (Phase 4)

Resource Balance:
- Units require gold maintenance per turn
- Cities require 2 food per population per turn
- Negative gold = units may disband
- Negative food = population decrease
```

#### 2.3 **Technology Research** üî¨
```typescript
Technology Tree (Ancient Era):
- Pottery: Enables Granary building
- Bronze Working: Enables Spearman unit
- Animal Husbandry: Enables Pasture improvement
- Sailing: Enables coastal exploration
- The Wheel: Enables road improvements

Research Mechanics:
- Linear tech progression with prerequisites
- Science points accumulated per turn
- Tech completion unlocks new units/buildings/improvements
- Eureka bonuses for specific achievements
```

**Phase 2 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Cities generate resources each turn automatically
- [ ] Players can build units and buildings from cities
- [ ] Technology research progresses and unlocks new options
- [ ] Resource management creates strategic decisions

---

### **Phase 3: Combat & Diplomacy (Week 5-6) - INTERACTION**
*Priority: MEDIUM - Adds player vs player engagement*

#### 3.1 **Combat System** ‚öîÔ∏è
```typescript
Combat Resolution:
- Damage calculation: (AttackStrength - DefenseStrength) * RandomModifier
- Terrain bonuses: Hills +25% defense, Forest +10% defense
- City siege: Must reduce city health to 0 before capture
- Unit experience: Gain XP from combat, unlock promotions

Combat Features:
- Unit vs unit combat with health tracking
- Ranged combat for archer units
- City bombardment capabilities
- Zone of control (units block movement)
```

#### 3.2 **Diplomacy Basics** ü§ù
```typescript
Diplomatic Actions:
- War/peace declarations with immediate effect
- Simple trade agreements (gold, resources per turn)
- Alliance system (shared vision, coordinated war)
- Chat integration with diplomatic quick-actions

Diplomatic States:
- Peace (default): No hostile actions allowed
- War: All hostile actions permitted
- Alliance: Shared benefits and coordinated actions
```

**Phase 3 Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Players can engage in tactical combat
- [ ] Cities can be captured through siege warfare
- [ ] Diplomatic relationships affect gameplay options
- [ ] Multi-player competitive gameplay emerges
