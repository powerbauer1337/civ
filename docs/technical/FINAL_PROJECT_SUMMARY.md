## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start development servers
npm run dev                 # Both client and server
# OR separately:
npm run dev:client         # Frontend only (port 5173)
npm run dev:server         # Backend only (port 4002)

# 3. Access the game
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173/civ/
# API: http://localhost:4002/api
```

### Testing & Validation
```bash
# Integration test
node docs/setup/test-complete-system.js

# Performance test  
node performance-test.js

# Health check
curl http://localhost:4002/health
```

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Production-Ready Security
- ✅ **Environment Validation**: Zod schemas prevent unsafe deployments
- ✅ **Auto-Generated Secrets**: Secure development keys (256-bit)
- ✅ **Input Validation**: All API endpoints validated
- ✅ **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin setup
- ✅ **Security Headers**: Helmet.js implementation
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive without information leakage

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Auto-generates secure secrets, detailed error messages
- **Production**: Requires explicit secrets, minimal error exposure
- **Validation**: Prevents production deployment with default secrets
